# Multi-variable-logistic-regression
In this dataset, a value of 1 indicates that the applicant is at high risk of defaulting, while 0 indicates that the loan is likely to be approved. The main goal is to predict the likelihood of loan repayment based on applicant and loan characteristics, helping banks and financial institutions make informed lending decisions and reduce financial risk.

The dataset used here was generated synthetically by ChatGPT to mimic real credit application data and does not contain actual applicant information.

Objectives:

Risk Assessment: Identify high-risk applicants who may default on loans.

Decision Support: Assist banks in approving or rejecting loans using data-driven predictions.

Optimizing Lending Policies: Adjust lending criteria based on predicted default probabilities.

Minimizing Losses: Reduce financial loss from non-repayment of loans.
